Shortest Path

Given a directed graph, find the length of the shortest path from 1 to N.

Input
N ≤ 1000, the number of vertices.
M ≤ 10000, the number of edges.
M lines, each with three integers a,b,c indicating a directed edge from a to b of length c.
Bonus: one case will have edges with negative lengths.
A shortest path will always exist.

Output
The length of the shortest path from vertex 1 to vertex N.

Sample Input
3 3
1 2 1
2 3 2
1 3 5

Sample Output
3

Take the path 1-2-3.
