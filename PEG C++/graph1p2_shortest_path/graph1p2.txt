Shortest Path

Given a graph as an adjacency matrix, find the shortest path from the first to the last vertex.

Input
N â‰¤ 100, the number of vertices.
The adjacency matrix - N rows of N numbers.
The first row represents the first vertex, and similarly the last row = the last vertex.

Output
The distance from the first vertex to the last one.
