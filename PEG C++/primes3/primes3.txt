Primes 3

Given T (1 ≤ T ≤ 100) positive integers, one per line, determine whether each one is prime. The integers will be no greater than 2^63−1.

The first line of input will be the integer T. The next T lines each contain a number to be tested.

For each of the T integers, you should output on a separate line PRIME if the corresponding integer is prime, or NOT if it is composite.
