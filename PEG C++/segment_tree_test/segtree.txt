Segment Tree Test

Perform the dynamic range minimum query.

Input
The first line of input will contain two space-separated integers: N (1 ≤ N ≤ 100 000), the number of elements in the array, and M (1 ≤ M ≤ 100 000), the number of operations to perform.

The next N lines each contain one non-negative integer less than 1 000 000. Specifically, line number i contains element i - 2 of the array. Note that the array has zero-based indexing.

The following M lines contain one operation each. Each operation is either of the form M i x, indicating that element number i (0 ≤ i < N) is to be changed to x (0 ≤ x < 1 000 000), or the form Q i j (0 ≤ i ≤ j < N) indicating that your program is to find the minimum value of the elements in the index range [i, j] (that is, inclusive) in the current state of the array and print this value to standard output.

Output
One integer, on its own line, for each Q statement: the answer to the query.
