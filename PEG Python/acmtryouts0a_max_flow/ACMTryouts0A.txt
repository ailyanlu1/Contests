A: Max Flow

Many computer scientists have nightmares about the daunting task of finding the max flow. Can you handle it?

There are T (1 ≤ T ≤ 10) scenarios. In each scenario, there are N (1 ≤ N ≤ 10) flows, and the value of the i-th flow is Fi (1 ≤ Fi ≤ 100) - your job is to find the largest of the flow values.

Input
Line 1: 1 integer, T
For each scenario:
Line 1: 1 integer, N
Next N lines: 1 integer, Fi, for i = 1..N

Output
For each scenario:
Line 1: The largest flow value.

Sample Input

1

Sample Output
5
1

Explanation of Sample
In the first scenario, the 4 flows have values of 2, 5, 3, and 5, respectively. The largest of these values is 5.

In the second scenario, the only flow has a value of 1, so the max flow is 1.
