Maximum Sum

Given an array of (positive) integers, find a subset with the maximal sum.
However, there is the additional restriction that no two numbers in the subset may be adjacent.

For example, for the array 4 5 6 9 10:
4 6 10 is valid, while 5 9 10 is invalid since 9 and 10 are next to each other.
4 6 10 happens to be the optimal sum in this case, so 20 is the answer.

Input
An integer 1 < N <= 100,000.
N lines, each with one positive integer in the sequence <= 1000

Output
The maximum sum possible.
