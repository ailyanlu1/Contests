Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an array of integers, find the longest increasing subsequence.
A subsequence is just a collection of numbers from the array - however, they must be in order.

For example:
Array: 1 2 5 4 3 6
The longest increasing subsequence here is 1 2 5 6 (or 1 2 4 6, or 1 2 3 6).
The numbers must be strictly increasing - no two numbers can be equal.

Input
N <= 5000, the number of integers.
N lines, each with a value in the array.

Output
The length of the longest increasing subsequence of the array.
